"SCTASK0012410","COG - Application Support","Unable to location Discipline Case Letter - Case Number: 10279127-M","Good afternoon to you, 

I hope that you are well. 

I wonder if you could provide me with some assistance please? This morning (21 October) I have updated a Club's Whole Game Record (Woofferton FC ) with details of a Charge being raised for Simon Bradley (FAN Number: 55770442) following an incident which took place in a recent match. The Case Number referring to this incident is: 10279127-M. 

Having completed the necessary update within the Club's record and completed the 'FA-Letter Processing' process, on checking within the 'Documents' section of the Club's Whole Game Record there seems to be no letter attached and/or retained. 

Would you be kind enough to carry out an investigation into locating the corresponding FA Letter associated to this individual and Case Number and attach it to the Club record and forward a copy of the letter to me enabling me to send it out to the individual? 

This anomaly has occurred on 2 occasions during the last 2 months and I am therefore wondering if this is a wider known ongoing issue within the Whole Game System Discipline function?

It is hoped that the information provided is found to be satisfactory and if you require any further information or have any questions then please don't hesitate to ask me. 

Your anticipated advice and guidance in this matter would be greatly appreciated, as always.

Good Afternoon, We have a Club Secretary (see above) who was previously a staff member at Huntingdonshire FA. There is a suggestion that there is still some conflicting CFA Access, which is affecting her ability to use WGS properly.

Some of the issues the club secretary is facing is;

- Can not handle discipline as it states that 'can not alter when logged on as another fan'
- Cannot log in using email, has to log in with FAN

This Club Secretary left our CFA a few weeks ago and as I understand it, had all access removed at the time.

Please advise if you can completely remove CFA access on her FAN"

I hope that you are well.

I'm just following up to request an update on this issue which was submitted 2 weeks ago.

I am aware that my CEO, Alan Darfi, 'Approved' this request on or about 20 September, but I have yet to hear on how the request is progressing.

I have also looked on the Portal and have been unable to locate an update to the request either.

In addition, I did not receive an acknowledgement to the e-mail which I originally sent requesting assistance on 15 September. For ease of reference, I have included a copy of the e-mail below:

Request to Help Locate FA Letter Following Discipline Hearing - Luke Wilkins: FAN No: 1633945

Good afternoon to you,

I hope that you are well.

I wonder if you could provide me with some assistance please?

This morning I have updated an individuals Whole Game Record (Luke Wilkins – FAN Number: 1633945) with the results of a Disciplinary Hearing that was held last week (Case Number: 10187792M) at the Herefordshire FA.

Having completed the necessary update within his record and completed the 'FA-Letter Processing' process, on checking within the 'Documents' section of this Whole Game Record there seems to be no letter attached and/or retained. 

Would you be kind enough to carry out an investigation into locating the corresponding FA Letter associated to this individual and Case Number and attach it to his record and forward a copy of the letter to me enabling me to send it out to the individual?

It is hoped that the information provided is found to be satisfactory and if you require any further information or have any questions then please don't hesitate to ask me.

Your anticipated advice and guidance in this matter would be greatly appreciated, as always.

It would be greatly appreciated if an update on this request could be provided please.

With kindest regards and take care.

"SCTASK0009973","COG - Application Support","Continued issues in blank/missing countries for users in FA Player","To the attention of Kasthuri/Smitha:

Good morning everyone, I hope you are well.

I wanted to follow up on a previous request that I raised (RITM0018122) which involves the lack of address information (specifically country) available to report in FA Player, where the information definitely does exist elsewhere.

For example, in FADW_Warehouse, no country information exists for the user with FAN of 65666223. 

However, if you look in MongoDB using the query:

db.getCollection('SingleView_Individual').find({fancode: 65666223})

you can clearly see under address list, that this particular FAN is from the United Kingdom and therefore should be shown in FADW_Warehouse under the SingleViewIndividualAddress table but is not, when using the command:

USE FADW_Warehouse
SELECT * from dbo.SingleViewIndividualAddress
WHERE fancode = '65666223'

This is one example of numerous that will be reported as blank within FA Player. The reason why this is continuously requested is because currently, The FA Player dashboard reports a total of almost 12,000 viewers who do not have a known country. This is over 10% of the total user base. 

We know some are for reasons that they will have subscribed as an FA user before it was required to place a country in, and we can live with that - however there will be a significant number of other members who do have a country that we need to pull across, otherwise the report by country is less meaningful.

If you wouldn't mind helping me out with this as soon as you are able to, that would be great. This is on the top of our requirements for improvements to FA Player at the moment, so is highest on the priority list for our stakeholder.

Please let me know, should you require any further information.

Thank you,

Andy."

Good afternoon to you,

I hope that you are well.

I wonder if you could provide me with some assistance please?

This morning I have updated an individuals Whole Game Record (Luke Wilkins – FAN Number: 1633945) with the results of a Disciplinary Hearing that was held last week (Case Number: 10187792M) at the Herefordshire FA.

Having completed the necessary update within his record and completed the 'FA-Letter Processing' process, on checking within the 'Documents' section of this Whole Game Record there seems to be no letter attached and/or retained. 

Would you be kind enough to carry out an investigation into locating the corresponding FA Letter associated to this individual and Case Number and attach it to his record and forward a copy of the letter to me enabling me to send it out to the individual?

It is hoped that the information provided is found to be satisfactory and if you require any further information or have any questions then please don't hesitate to ask me.

Your anticipated advice and guidance in this matter would be greatly appreciated, as always.

Hi Sohail, 

Last time with the proxy issue it had to be fixed per user. As sejal and I can currently send emails out through GP (through the existing inboxes) we should not encounter this issue but highlighting  just in case.   

The passwords/access for the 3 inboxes are crucial for us to test. Is there not anyone else that can send me the password for the 3 inboxes? i.e cognizant? Or anyone else in that team?

Thanks

Thanks for the update Sharon,

Moving Collections customer import to 15,17 or 18 Sept is fine.   Please note Vijay is on holiday that week.

Re: this comment  ""Vijay has stated that, for go live, Club Wembley customers will probably not be using a Collections Plan as the process is unlikely to be agreed and email addresses may not be available""  will Vijay and his team be trained to implement this themselves at a future date or will the FA require  additional ABS consultancy in the future?


Should we create test emails addresses to test emails.  When we did the Proactis EDI project we created and still have test inboxes (see screenshot below) or do you plan to redirect emails to testers inboxes?

Subject: Collections Test Data Migration

Hi All
 
Vijay and I discussed his requirements yesterday afternoon.
 
The Collections  Info and Address data will still need to be modified (changing email addresses to an FA one) and passed from the receivables tables into the Collections tables.  This is a 2 step process using merge macros will be used as we cannot use Integration Manager and Smart Connect is not yet available.  A day will still be needed for this. BTW, @Sohail/Vijay/Doug would it be possible to move this day to the 15th, 17th or 18th please, I stupidly missed an appointment out of my calendar in my calendar, early afternoon. If this doesn't work, I can still work on the 16th until midday.
 
 
 
1)	Change the email address for each customers' MAIN address to an FA one (so emails aren't accidentally sent to customers during testing!)
2)	Pull through the agreed fields into the Collections main address for each customer (see above and all agreed with Vijay already).  Vijay to provide, if possible, a list of customers with email addresses and those without as these customers will need to be imported separately.  If not possible, please give me a few days notice @Vijay.  Thanks
 
Vijay has stated that, for go live, Club Wembley customers will probably not be using a Collections Plan as the process is unlikely to be agreed and email addresses may not be available.  The FA should work towards imported email addresses into the Customer Records as they are integrated from CRM.  @Vijay/Sohail, please can you let Paddy know if you need any assistance from Advantage with this. 
 
Sejal is working on getting all live customer email address entered against their MAIN address ID in time for go live.
 
Hope that brings things up to date for everyone.
 
Kind Regards
 
Sharon"

 Darren, 
I hope you're well.
I've just tried calling to see if you could help me out with an issue that's possibly related to the other matter that you got in touch about recently (above)...I've had my MacBook sleeping for about 2-3 weeks (there was some uncertainty over whether we should be installing the latest software update [which popped up saying that I should reboot my Mac to initiate the update] before I had some time off, and I'd then forgot about it since returning), and just this afternoon closed everything down in order to do the software update. While trying to shut it down it said it wouldn't shut down due to a 'Microsoft recovery error' (I think that was how it was phrased), and that I should do a 'force quit' to close this so that the Mac could be shut down.
I let it shut down and then came back to it about an hour later - while trying to start the Mac up again it keeps going on a cycle of getting me to enter my password, then it sounds like it's revving up for about a second before stopping (the revs), then either (a) a white circle with a white diagonal line appears on the black screen OR (b) some text appears saying 'Your computer hasn't restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up.' before then moving onto what I've said for (a)...and then nothing...if I touch the keyboard it then takes me back to where I click on my name and enter my password, and so on...
Any help you can offer would be much appreciated.
Thank you.
Gareth"

Hello, I hope you are both well.

I wanted to raise a request based on the work that Andreas has been doing, in a similar vein to the request I raised yesterday on subscription numbers to FA Player.

From the screenshot attached you can see a particular FAN who has an address in the UK through MongoDB:

Currently, I cannot find this person's country of residence in any table within the FADW_Warehouse - in SingleViewIndividualAddress he has no entry although he has an entry in SingleViewIndividual table.

The big issue with this is that it's not 1 member, we have a particular date (29/08) of subscriptions to FA Player where 92% of subscriptions do not have a country attributed to them in these tables, which is over 1,000 members. I have tried a further 3 accounts all with the same issue. 

If you wouldn't mind looking into this, that would be much appreciated. I recommend concentrating on signups for this date as this seems to be the main issue.

Thanks,

Andy."

 My home internet is working very badly  and have experienced dropping out of hearings and problems with the quality of connection such that it has hampered cross-examinations and other aspects of tribunal hearings. 

If we have to abort hearings due to this problem, rescheduling will create massive cost implications for The FA in having to reconvene hearings.  As such, I have liaised with my line manager and we would like to request a stand alone  4G hub in order to address these issues. This request, as you will appreciate, is urgent given that I have a number of tribunal hearings in the coming weeks.

I have included an attachment within this request a screen shot of the message that is displayed when using the Ghost Login.

 I have checked and have been unable to find any additional FAN number that may have been created in error and so eliminated that potential reason for not being able to gain access.

Therefore, would you be able to investigate this issue on both mine and David's behalf.

As always, your assistance and support in these matters are very much appreciated.

With kindest regards.

Hi Sohail,

To make you fully aware, I will be running the year-end close processes on the weekend of 22nd/23rd August. All users will need to be out of all GP entities by 3pm on Friday 21st August – I will send an email to the GP Users distribution list nearer the time.

Please can you make sure the following happens:

•	A full back-up is done for each GP18 entity on the evening of Friday 21st August
•	No other GP maintenance processes are scheduled for the weekend of 22nd/23rd August

Please can you also confirm whether I will be able to test the year-end close processes in the GP Test entities before the weekend of 22nd/23rd August?

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Raise 1 ticket. Don't want multiple triggers going out to users unless you want to log it under my name and bypass line manager approval.

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

 

Adam

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

 

Adam

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

 

Adam

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Raise 1 ticket. Don't want multiple triggers going out to users unless you want to log it under my name and bypass line manager approval.

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Sure Rahul.

 

I`ll speak with Sharad and get normal requests raised under your name. The request category shall follow no approvals but we will change subject line.

 

You will receive the emails though. Will that be ok?

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul

 

Hope all is well

 

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

 

We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence
 

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached

94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?
 

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

 

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

 

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Rahul 

Hope all is well

See attached the current list of all requested Power BI licences for County FA's. Note on this list we have 102 submissions however we are going to need a minimum of 108 licences

•	We have allocated 1 licence to all County FA CEO's = 50
•	We have then allocated 1 additional licence to 1 staff member within each county
•	You will see on the list that some Counties have not yet submitted a 2nd person (6 CFAs)
•	However you will also see on the list some counties have submitted more than there allocation which they would like to pay the 3 year fee of £270 per licence

Therefore please can you allocate a licence for all of the 102 attached
•	94 of these licences are from the 100 allocation which The FA is paying for. @Katrina Caraska is chasing up the remaining 6 individuals from those CFAs yet to submit. However this maybe due the CFA completing a workforce review following the recent funding cuts and therefore are not able to confirm yet
•	8 of these licences are at cost price to the County FA which I will be deducting from their August 31st salary grant payment (£270 per licence x 8 = £2160)
•	When I make this deduction I will need a code in which to transfer this money to which will offset any charge you incur for additional licences, please can you provide this?

Please can you ensure that these licences are allocated to all staff on this list before COP Wednesday 29th July? We are going live with the product to all Counties on Friday 31st therefore keen to ensure that these are completed a day prior to this in case of any issue.

Once we confirm the additional 6 free licences I will ensure these are sent across. Following this we will close this process and all additional licences will  be at cost and go via the IT support process which you confirmed with Will.

Can you let me know if there are any issues with this

Hi Taran,
Dean advised that Rahul agreed to do it this way as the process for logging Power BI requests is not in place.

I have attached an updated version of the list of users.

Wouldn't it be easier to track in one logged call rather than lots of different tickets which will become difficult to track.  ?  

Regards,

Sohail

Hi Sohail,

As discussed we will only get the licences by 1st July and post that team will be able to allocate them accordingly. 

With regards to installation, please can I request necessary service requests to be raised, so this can be actioned accordingly. 

Ideally we need to track all the installations in our ITSM tool.

Hi all

I wasn't sure who to contact so I have reached out to all of you in hope that you will be able to point me in the right direction. 

As part of the new report Karen from Touchstone has built for us we are able to retrieve links to directly take us to the posted invoice. Unfortunately, this feature currently isn't working because we need to have an IIS reset completed. I am not entirely sure what this is but I am assuming someone will do. 

Do you know who I can who the correct person is to organise this?

Thanks
Darren

Hi Darren,
 
Zeeshan has just reminded me that you need Cognizant to perform an IIS reset before this feature will work.
 
Could you please arrange for that to be done??
 
If your techies need any further information, they can log a call using the normal process and we can help them.
 
Thanks,
Karen.

Hi Karen
 
See comments below:
 
The link still doesn't work. I am getting this error message:
 
 
The Proactis order link does the same thing
 
 
I have also looked up some ways to get this hyperlink into the report but none that are really preferential:
•	Macro – this will enable to link in the pivot table but comes with risks:
o	Due to security issues users will need to always enable the macro in order for it to work
o	If the macro stops working not many people will know how to fix it
•	Adding the field into a pivot then hiding the column – The link will be a formula outside of the pivot table but will also link. This only works if the structure of the pivot table never changes in length, width or moving dimensions/measures.
•	Adding a column in power query to return a hyperlink but you would need to always replace the character ' in the column each time you refresh the report. You can also shorten the length of text with this option.
 
None of the above are ideal and don't really save any time currently from searching in the data tab and then double clicking the link. I will keep researching on this as I am convinced there will be a solution.
 
Thanks
Darren

Hi Darren – here's an updated version in prep for our next session.
 
The actions we noted include:
1.	Check the Invoice/PO links work – and see if they include the invoice payment date – Still not working
2.	Add the Business Partners name to the Query to restrict the data that's returned – I have left the query filter on the division description but this would work for someone like Michelle who looks after lots of divisions and would be faster.
3.	Add the Nominal Group field to the Query (first three characters of the nominal code) – This formula has been written in Power Query and is functioning correctly.
4.	Potential future changes:
•	Account Category from GP (checking the GP data is reliable before using this) – Check on this confirms this has been completed by Advantage. Important to maintain for anything created in the future.
•	Add Invoice Payment Date to the Data Warehouse (the link may provide a short-term fix?) – This I think is important and will be a great addition to report.
 
I look forward to the next time you get chance to look at this, so we can continue to make it end-user friendly and ready for rollout.
 
Cheers,
Karen."

I hope that you are well.

With the recent arrival of the Herefordshire FA's new CEO (Alan Darfi – FAN Number: 58636527) effective from 9 March 2020, I have tried to update his various 'Football Roles' within his record on Whole Game System.

As can be seen in the screenshot provided in the attached document, I have been able to update his record showing that he is a member of our 'CFA-Board', 'CFA-County Staff' and 'CFA-Senior Safeguarding Lead',  using the 'Add Official' icon when updating the Herefordshire FA's details retained on Whole Game.

 Unfortunately, when I attempt to update his 'Football Role' with the inclusion of his role of CEO, the drop down menu does not now provide the option of 'CFA-CEO', as can be seen in the second screenshot provided in the attached document.

Therefore, would you please be able to advise me how I can update his 'Football Roles' to include 'CFA-CEO'?

Also, I am trying to 'End Role' of his 'Club Secretary-Alan Darfi' from the 2017-2018 Season (as displayed in the first screenshot), but the system will not let me do so until this position is updated with a replacement.  As this is a role that finished at the end of that Season and as he has moved away from that area, would you be able to manually update his record with an 'End Role' date, enabling these details to be removed from his record, or provide me with advice on how I can rectify this issue?

Again, I have provided a third screenshot containing the message which Whole Game displays when I try to update this area.

It is hoped that the information provided is found to be satisfactory and if you have any further questions then please don't hesitate to ask me.

As always, your support and guidance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

With kindest regards.

I wonder if you would be able to provide some further assistance to a request which was submitted previously (INC0021359) earlier this month.

When the request 'INC0021359' was submitted regarding gaining remote access to the Herefordshire FA Shared Drive using personal laptops I was informed that, for security reasons, the Herefordshire FA staff members (now a revised total of 3) who do not have FA Enabled laptops nor have the facility to 'plug in' and use a desktop at home would not be able to have their personal laptops adapted remotely by FA IT.

Now, after 2 weeks of working remotely from home with very limited access in order to carry out their regular working practices, I have been informed by my CEO (Alan Darfi) that such a facility does exist for a limited number of User (approx 100) for FA IT to enable personal laptops to gain remote access.

I am therefore enquiring if this provision is available to CFAs enabling the 3 undermentioned staff members to have their personal laptops adapted remotely by FA IT enabling full access remotely to the Server for a limited period of time (5 weeks):

     Paul Cotton              -              paul.cotton@herefordshirefa.com
     Ben Archer                -              Ben.archer@herefordshirefa.com
     Diane Phillips          -               Diane.phillips@herefordshirefa.com

FA Enabled laptop have since been ordered for our 3 Staff members for the long term solution to this issue, but I have been informed that the process is currently taking 4-5 weeks before individuals will receive the necessary equipment, hence the request for a limited timeframe for access. 

It is therefore requested if access can be provided in the short term for our 3 members of Staff in order to alleviate the ongoing issue of not been able to work effectively from home. 

Your continued assistance with this request would be greatly appreciated, as always.

With kindest regards.

I have recently submitted a number of Service Requests for IT support and when I received an automated acknowledgement e-mail from FA IT it stated that notification may be sent to my Line Manager, Simon Panes, for approval.

Simon Panes actually handed over his role as CEO Herefordshire FA last year to Darren Lawrence who has subsequently handed over the CEO role to my new and current CEO, Alan Darfi, effective from 9 March 2020. 

Would you be able to update your records to reflect my new CEO's details, which are:

I'd like to raise a request please to provide us (the Business Analytics team) access to a table that currently sits in the WEMGENSQL3 server to be copied to SV SQL which we can access through the jump server. 

The table has already been created by Firas Ridha and is part of a piece of work that we are undertaking for Club Wembley that is of the highest priority. This table is used by us to inform Club Wembley of the engagement and likely renewal of every Club Wembley member, which potentially will significantly influence a £50m per annum revenue source for us throughout this year. We need access to it in order to build reports and dashboards relating to the data.

The table would need to be refreshed on a daily basis as we expect data within this table to change on an ongoing basis. For ease, we would request this table to be accessed in the early hours – such as 1am or 2am, whichever has less load on any other queries that are being run.

The table details we want access to are:
•	Server: WEMGENSQL3
•	Database: FADW_Mart
•	Table Name: DimCognizantFortressEventAttendance

The jump server we access has the following details:

•	IP Address: 10.212.180.7
•	Users (if necessary): achristley, ayiannakou, jboulton

As mentioned, we would need this to be done for us as soon as possible. This workstream has been in place for a while now and involves ourselves, Keith Thompson, Naveen, Firas, Udara and Martin Head.

Hi,

Can I raise Ticket 12725 regarding Wildcats centres to you please? I have still not been able to get onto Service Now so I will raise it this way instead. I hope that's okay.

The customer wants to remove Application ID-347 and Application ID-4629 as one is a test centre and the other is no longer running.

They also wish to remove Application ID-4729 and Application ID-4730 from their 'under review' tab in the Events Engine platform because they were both created by accident.

"SCTASK0000019","COG - Application Support","SV_SQL - Club Affiliation Validation (PLEASE ASSIGN TO RUN TEAM)","Hi Bala,

Think I raised this one very briefly before, but finding the time today I had another look at the SV_SQL DB and I cannot validate the team numbers which are currently stored in the 'WGSTeams' table.

I have pasted some screenshots below, but without a 'Clubs' and/or 'Affiliation' table I don't think I can filter the teams counts to what is should be which should be close to 93k.
Do you know if this is possible (i.e. me not looking in the right place or using the correct fields to filter)?

The danger of this kind of number being incorrect is how it is used to affect marketing campaigns through Emarsys.
Imo we shouldn't be sharing marketing comms with individuals who haven't yet completed the Club/Team affiliation process.

Cheers,
James"
